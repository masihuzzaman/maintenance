  <p>Question: My compressor is overheating, what do I do?

Answer: Clean coolers and check thermostatic valve.

Compressing air generates a lot of heat. We need to get rid of that heat, or the compressor’s internal temperature will rise too high.

Because heat is continuously generated when the compressor is running, it’s a constant battle to remove all this heat.

For this, we need a large amount of (ambient) cooling air, and of course a clean cooler. When your coolers get dirty, it requires a bigger and bigger temperature difference to transfer the heat to the cooling air.

In other words: the compressor temperature keeps rising and rising.

If your coolers are already clean: check the thermostatic valve. Sometimes it’s jammed and no oil is send to the cooler for cooling

Question: I have oil in my compressed air.

Answer: Check oil separation system.

Inside the compressor, the compressor oil is mixes with the air during compression. The main task of the oil is to remove the heat from compression.

Of course, we want this oil to stay inside the compressor. We don’t want it in our compressed air lines.

For this, every oil-injected rotary screw compressor has an oil-separation system. Oil is separated in two steps: first centrifugal force and second by the separator filter.

The first step removes around 85% of all the oil. The separator filter removes the remaining 15%.

If you have oil in your system: check when was the last time the oil separator was replaced!

Question: My compressor is running, but not producing any air.

Answer: Check loading system and inlet valve.

Screw compressors can run both ‘loaded’ and ‘unloaded’. When running unloaded, the motor is running, but the air-inlet is closed, so the compressor is not pumping any air.

The loading and unloading is done by opening and closing the inlet valve.

Most inlet valves are operated by compressed air (of course!) and controlled by an electro-pneumatic valve called a ‘solenoid valve’.

But there could be a number of other problems which are causing these problems.
